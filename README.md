# Environment variables in Node.js

## Task description

In this exercise, you will learn how to work with environment variables in Node.js. You will learn different techniques to retrieve and create environment variables. By the end of the exercise, you will be able to effectively use environment variables in your Node.js applications.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Retrieving Environment Variables

Create a Node.js application that retrieves the environment variable `NODE_ENV` and prints it to the console. Verify that the environment variable is retrieved correctly.

### Task 2: Creating environment variables

Please create an environment variable with the name `API_KEY` and any value of your choice using the terminal command. Print the value of the environment variable on the console to make sure it is set correctly.

### Task 3: Using the `dotenv` library

Use the `dotenv` library to load environment variables from an `.env` file. Create a `.env` file and define an environment variable in it with the name `DB_HOST` and any value of your choice. Make sure that the environment variable is loaded correctly in your Node.js application using the `dotenv` library.
